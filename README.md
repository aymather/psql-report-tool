Welcome to Alec's awesome reporting code :D

There is only one python file needed to run my report.
From the command line, run the following:

python report.py

Here is what will happen:

1. My file will then scan and collect the necessary data
    from the 'news' database.

2. If the file 'report.txt' exists, that file will be destroyed
    and a new file with the same name will be created.

3. It will then write the necessary data into 'report.txt' and Bah-Bahm!
    You've got your data :)

Loved the project, can't wait for the rest of the course!
